The ocean whispers ancient tales,
Of moonlit nights and wandering whales,
Where waves caress the sandy shore,
And secrets lie in depths of lore.

Beneath the surface, shadows dance,
In rhythmic waves, a wild romance,
Coral castles, vibrant, bright,
Guard the mysteries of the night.

The tides, they pull, they push, they sway,
Guiding lost souls on their way,
A melody of ebb and flow,
The ocean sings what few can know.

In endless blue, the sky's embrace,
The ocean finds its timeless grace,
A world beneath, serene and vast,
Where future meets the echoes past.

So let the oceanâ€™s song be heard,
In every wave, a whispered word,
For in its depths, we find the key,
To all the wonders yet to be.
